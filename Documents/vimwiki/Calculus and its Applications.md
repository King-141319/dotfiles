# definition
### Function:
> A function f consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs and a rule for assigning each input exactly one output. The set of inputs is called the domain of the function. The set of outputs is called the range of the function.

### Vertical line test
> Given a function f, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of f no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.

### Zeros
> X-intercept

### Composite function
> Consider the function f with domain A and range B, and the function g with doamin D and range E. If B is a subset of D, then the composite function (g*f)(x) is the function with domain A such that (g*f)(x) = g(f(x))).

### Even function
> If f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the doamin of f, then f is an even function. An even function is symmetric about the y-axis.

### Odd function
If f(x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain of f, then f is an odd function. An odd function is symmetric about the origin.

### The quadratic formula
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ 
$$

### Transcendental functions
> a transendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy a polynomial equation whose coefficients are functions of the independent variable that can be written using only the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Such as trigonomitric, exponential and logarithmic functions.

### Piecewise-Defined Functions
> Sometimes a function is defined by differnt formulas on different parts of its domain. A function with this property is known as a piecewise-defined function. The absolute value function is an example of a piecewise-defined funtion because the formula changes withh the sign of x:

### Horizontal test
A function f is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal intersects the graph of f no mor than once
