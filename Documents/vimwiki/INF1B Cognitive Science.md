1. [How Computational Modeling Can Force Theory Building in Psychological Science](https://journals-sagepub-com.eux.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620970585)   

### Reading note

Process of making cognitive Modelling
Data -> Hypothesis -> Implementation -> Specification -> Theory -> Framework

Data: "I eated the cheerios."
Hypothesis: Thhe child wiill saay "eated" more than "ate"
Implementation: def past-tense(verb): return verb + 'ed'
Specification: The child makes the past tense by adding "-ed" tp any verb
Theory: Words and Rules
Framework: Sympol Manipulation vs Neural Networks
